# Dotify by Sean Yang

This is a second version of a music player. The main part of the player is a list of musics.
A user can click on any music in the list and the mini player in the bottom will show
the current music playing. When a user clicks on the mini player, the screen will be directed
to a full player. User can go back to list by clicking on the back button below. 
Unfortunately this version does not support user changes.
